# 🚀 Prometheus Remote Write with .NET 🌍

This project demonstrates how to send Prometheus metrics using Remote Write between OpenShift clusters using a .NET application, with a setup similar to the Thanos architecture.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The aim of this project is to:
- Create a .NET project that shows relationships like **Thanos** in Prometheus.
- Implement **Remote Write** for Prometheus metrics to move data between OpenShift clusters.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:
- 🖥️ OpenShift cluster (or local CRC - CodeReady Containers)
- 💻 .NET SDK installed ([Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Prometheus installed on both your OpenShift clusters

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PrometheusRemoteWrite.git
   cd PrometheusRemoteWrite
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the Prometheus client library for .NET:

   ```bash
   dotnet add package prometheus-net
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Project**:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
   ```

This will start the .NET project, exposing a counter metric that increments every second and makes it available for Prometheus to scrape.

## 📝 Prometheus Configuration

Make sure your `prometheus.yml` is configured to use Remote Write. Add the following lines to enable Prometheus to send data to a remote Prometheus server:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://<target-cluster>:9091/api/v1/write"
    queue_config:
      max_samples_per_send: 100
      batch_send_deadline: 5s
```

## 🚀 Dockerize and Deploy to OpenShift

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   
   ```dockerfile
   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
   WORKDIR /app
   EXPOSE 80

   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build
   WORKDIR /src
   COPY . .
   RUN dotnet restore
   RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app

   FROM base AS final
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=build /app .
   ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "PrometheusRemoteWrite.dll"]
   ```

2. **Build and Push the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t yourregistry/PrometheusRemoteWrite .
   docker push yourregistry/PrometheusRemoteWrite
   ```

3. **Deploy to OpenShift**:

   Use the following command to deploy the Docker image on OpenShift:

   ```bash
   oc new-app --docker-image=yourregistry/PrometheusRemoteWrite
   ```

## 📸 Pauses for Debugging

To allow for easier debugging or taking screenshots, add a delay between the metrics being pushed, for example:

```csharp
await Task.Delay(10000); // Pausing for 10 seconds
```

## 💡 Future Enhancements

Here are a few things you could add next:
- Implementing additional Prometheus metrics (histograms, summaries).
- Set up **Thanos** for multi-cluster federation.
- Add monitoring alerts with **Alertmanager**.
